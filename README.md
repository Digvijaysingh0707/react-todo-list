Created a ToDo List App that connects to a Node Server and interacts with mongoDB on atlas.

**<a href="https://ghughes-react-todo-list.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">See the project</a>**
<br>*Heroku has to spin up the React app, then the node server so it might take a minute to load. It also breaks if there are no items in the todo list

==============================
Todo:<br>
-Fix bug where it breaks if there are no items
-Make Responsive<br>
-Add User Authentication<br>
