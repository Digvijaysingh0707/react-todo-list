# MERN STACK TODO LIST

### Description
Created a ToDo List App that connects to a Node Server and interacts with mongoDB on atlas and executes CRUD operations.

_*Heroku has to spin up the React app, then the node server so it might take a minute to load. It also breaks if there are no items in the todo list_
